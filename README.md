# GoogLeNet
Implementation of GoogLeNet image classification network based on TensorFlow 2.0.

The neural network architecture proposed by Szegedy et al. exploits the current hardware’s computing power on dense matrices. As a result, the network can be wider and deeper while in the meantime consumes a similar amount of computing power as former networks.
